{"name":"Docker-wpdev","tagline":"Wordpress in Docker","body":"# docker-wpdev\r\n\r\nA nice and easy way to get a Wordpress instance up and running using docker. For\r\nhelp on getting started with docker see the [official getting started guide][0].\r\nFor more information on Wordpress and check out it's [website][1].\r\n\r\nIt uses:\r\n    \r\n- PHP 5.5\r\n- Xdebug  [see guide][2] for tips how to use\r\n- Xcache\r\n- Nginx\r\n\r\n## Building docker-wpdev\r\n\r\nRunning this will build you a docker image with the latest stable version of both\r\ndocker-wpdev and Wordpress itself. You can use Git to manage your Wordpress version.\r\n\r\n    git clone https://github.com/dz0ny/docker-wpdev.git\r\n    cd docker-wpdev\r\n    git submodule update --init --recursive\r\n    sudo docker build -t dz0ny/wpdev .\r\n\r\n## Notes on Wordpress\r\n\r\nEverything you do is in the ```web/content``` folder(plugins, themes). This way all your code is\r\nseparated from actual Wordpress install and enables you to quickly switch Wordpress versions.\r\n\r\n## Running docker-wpdev\r\n\r\nIf this is the only thing running on your system you can map the port to 80 and no\r\nproxy is needed. i.e. `-p=80:80`.\r\n\r\n    sudo docker run -p=80:80 -v=$(pwd)/web:/srv/wordpress dz0ny/wpdev\r\n\r\nFrom now on when you start/stop docker-wpdev you should use the container id\r\nwith the following commands. To get your container id, after you initial run\r\ntype `sudo docker ps` and it will show up on the left side followed by the image\r\nname which is `dz0ny/wpdev:latest`.\r\n\r\n    sudo docker start <container_id>\r\n    sudo docker stop <container_id>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Notes on the run command\r\n\r\n + `-v` is the volume you are mounting `-v=host_dir:docker_dir`\r\n + `dz0ny/wpdev` is simply what I called my docker build of this image\r\n + `-d=true` allows this to run cleanly as a daemon, remove for debugging\r\n + `-p` is the port it connects to, `-p=host_port:docker_port`\r\n\r\n\r\n[0]: http://www.docker.io/gettingstarted/\r\n[1]: https://wordpress.org\r\n[2]: https://jtreminio.com/2012/07/xdebug-and-you-why-you-should-be-using-a-real-debugger/\r\n","google":"UA-41748838-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
